How to run/compile the program:
1. Make sure the configuration file and region file are in the same directory as program files. 
2. Open Terminal and type "g++ *.cpp" to compile the program.
3. Type "./a.out" to run the program.
4. Enter the configuration file name when promoted.
5. Watch the growth begin!
6. Growth will stop after no change between two time steps.
7. Once the growth stops you will need to input coordinates to analyze (just type spaces between coords).
