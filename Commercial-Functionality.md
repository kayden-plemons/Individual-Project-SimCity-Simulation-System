**Funtionality**

The functionality of the Commercial zones is implemented in its own Commercial.cpp and Commercial.h files. These files will need to be able to access/modify StoredRegion and UpdatedRegion from the SharedVectors files. There will be a class for Commercial and functions inside that class to help check for growth. Keeping the location of the 'C' region zones private in a pair integer 2D Vector.

**Purpose**

The purpose of the commercial functionality is to model population growth in commercial zones based on proximity to power sources and surrounding population density. By simulating growth through these dependencies, commercial zones expand in a controlled manner, similar to real-world commercial development, which thrives in populated areas with accessible resources. This functionality integrates with the broader simulation, allowing commercial growth to respond to neighboring industrial and residential areas and reflect realistic patterns of urban development. This structured expansion supports the simulationâ€™s objective to balance economic activity and resource distribution across all zones.

**How data was stored/maintained:**

Commercial class is created with public functions constructor, initialize, Update, CountAdjacentPop, AdjacentToPowerline, and an integer variable to count zone population. InitializeCommercial is called from the main file which Traverses the StoredRegion vector and saves all 'C' locations and saves them in a private vector commercial storing the coordinates as pairs. Then UpdatedCommercial function is called inside of the time step loop in the main file. This function iterates through all coordinate pairs in the Commercial vector and passes them onto UpdatComPopulaiton. The UpdateComPopultion function is the main growth function for this zone, it uses if-else statements to follow rules for growth calling AdjacentToPowerline and CountAdjacentPop. Inside this function, integer currentpopultion is found by using the passed coordinates and aligning them equal to the UpdatedRegion population vector. AdjacentToPowerline is a boolean function that is called by the grow function to check cell adjacency to "T", "P", and "#", started with integers vectors that represent checking up to 8 different adjacent cells and comparing the coordinates to StoredRegion. CountAdjacentPop is an integer function that returns a count and gets passed the region coordinates and min population number, using an if statement it compares 8 directions checking for population number in the UpdatedRegion vector.
