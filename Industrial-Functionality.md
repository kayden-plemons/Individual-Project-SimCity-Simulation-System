**Functionality**

The functionality of the Industrial zones is implemented in its own Industrial.cpp and Industrial.h files. These files will need to be able to access/modify StoredRegion and UpdatedRegion from the SharedVectors files. There will be a class for Industrial and functions inside that class to help check for growth. Keeping the location of the 'I' region zones private in a pair integer 2D Vector.

**Purpose**

The purpose of the industrial functionality is to model realistic population growth in industrial zones while accounting for the influence of nearby power sources and population density. By simulating growth in this structured way, industrial zones in the simulation expand based on adjacency to power sources and surrounding populations, emulating how real-world industrial areas grow under similar dependencies. This system also integrates with pollution spread, illustrating the environmental impact of industrial growth and allowing the simulation to represent a balance of economic growth and pollution within the simulated region.

**How data was stored/maintained:**

Industrial class is created with public functions constructor, initialize, Update, CountAdjacentPop, AdjacentToPowerline, and an integer variable to count zone population. InitializeIndustrial is called from the main file which Traverses the StoredRegion vector and saves all 'I' locations and saves them in a private vector Industrial storing the coordinates as pairs. Then UpdatedIndustrial function is called inside of the time step loop in the main file. This function iterates through all coordinate pairs in the Industrial vector and passes them onto UpdatIndPopulaiton. The UpdateIndPopultion function is the main growth function for this zone, it uses if-else statements to follow rules for growth calling AdjacentToPowerline and CountAdjacentPop. Inside this function integer currentpopultion is found by using the passed coordinates and aligning them equal to the UpdatedRegion population vector. AdjacentToPowerline is a boolean function that is called by the grow function to check cell adjacency to "T", "P", and "#", started with integers vectors that represent checking up to 8 different adjacent cells and comparing the coordinates to StoredRegion. CountAdjacentPop is an integer function that returns a count and gets passed the region coordinates and min population number, using an if statement it compares 8 directions checking for population number in UpdatedRegion vector.
