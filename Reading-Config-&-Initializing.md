**Functionality**

The collection of these files serves as the foundation of the whole program. The config file will determine intermediate values that are important in running the simulation. The region file will be the layout of the city, and will be necessary to stimulate growth, pollution, residents, and everything else throughout the simulation. The simulation can be initialized after the config and region are read and stored. After the program has been run using main.cpp, utilizing industrial.cpp, residential.cpp, and all the other files, the final analysis of the region can be displayed.

**Purpose**

The purpose of reading the config and region files is to establish the core parameters and city layout essential for running the simulation. The config file provides key settings like time steps, refresh rate, and the region file name, which guide the simulation's progression. Once read, these values initialize the StoredRegion vector, which holds the city's initial layout and allows each zone (e.g., residential, industrial) to refer to the starting configuration throughout the simulation. Simultaneously, the UpdatedRegion vector is created to track dynamic changes, starting with all values at zero and updating as the simulation progresses. With both the layout and parameters set, the program is ready to simulate city growth, pollution, and zone interactions accurately over time.

**How data was stored/maintained:**

The main file asks the user to input the config file name. The string is then passed into a function PassConfigFile which is stored in a separate file called SharedVectors. From here, the config file is opened, and using end-of-file iterations, variables like region file name, time steps, and refresh rate are stored. Once those variables are stored a function is called inside of PassConfigFile called LoadRegion layout. LoadRegionlayout opens the region file and stores the comma-separated values in a 2D character vector called StoredRegion. StoredRegion is the main vector all files will access when referring to the original given layout. Initialize UpdatedRegion which will represent population growth and is called from main which creates a size copy but allocates for integers only starting at 0s. The program is now ready for growth and zone file cooperation.
