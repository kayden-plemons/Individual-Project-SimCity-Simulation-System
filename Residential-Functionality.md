**Functionality**

The functionality of the Residential zones is implemented in its own Residential.cpp and Residential.h files. These files will need to be able to access/modify StoredRegion and UpdatedRegion from the SharedVectors files. There will be a class for Residential and functions inside that class to help check for growth. Keeping the location of the 'R' region zones private in a pair integer 2D Vector. 

**Purpose**

The purpose of the residential functionality is to simulate and manage the dynamic growth of population in residential zones within a larger regional simulation. Specifically, it serves to model population expansion in response to neighboring cell conditions and infrastructure, such as proximity to power lines, to reflect how populations realistically grow based on environmental incentives and constraints. This also establishes an essential connection between residential zones and other areas by providing workers that supply labor to industrial and commercial zones, balancing resource needs across the simulated environment.

**How data was stored/maintained:**

Residential class is created with public functions constructor, initialize, Update, CountAdjacentPop, AdjacentToPowerline, and an integer variable to count zone population. InitializeResidential is called from the main file which Traverses the StoredRegion vector and saves all 'R' locations and saves them in a private residential storing the coordinates as pairs. Then UpdatedResidential function is called inside of the time step loop in the main file. This function iterates through all coordinate pairs in the residential vector and passes them onto UpdateResPopulaiton. The UpdateResPopultion function is the main growth function for this zone, it uses if-else statements to follow rules for growth calling AdjacentToPowerline and CountAdjacentPop. Inside this function integer currentpopultion is found by using the passed coordinates and aligning them equal to the UpdatedRegion population vector. The first rule checked is if the current population is equal to 0 and AdjacentToPowerline then UpdatedRegion, Workers, PopulationCount will increase + 1. The rest of the rules will check if the current population is equal to 1, 2, 3, and 4 and in sequence with AdjacentPopultionCount 1, 2, 3, and 4, then UpdatedRegion, Workers, PopulationCount will increase + 1. AdjacentToPowerline is a boolean function that is called by the grow function to check cell adjacency to "T", "P", and "#", started with integers vectors that represent checking up to 8 different adjacent cells and comparing the coordinates to StoredRegion. CountAdjacentPop is an integer function that returns a count and gets passed the region coordinates and min population number, using an if statement it compares 8 directions checking for population number in UpdatedRegion vector.
